Samrux's Virtuous weapon pack! Aiming to create new and fun weapon mechanics.

UPDATE 1.1: See forum thread or discord server for patchnotes.

Have you ever wanted to shoot an arrow at the sky and have it rain despair on your enemies, fling your foes into the air and make them take fall damage, or hastily punch mobs to death like in a true anime scene? In this first release we include 19 unique weapons to play around with, most of which balanced for late-hardmode to Moon Lord.

Featuring:
 - The Gobbler: This fantastic invention allows you to suck up any item from the ground, and then shoot them at your enemies! Each and every item in the game will possess different damage, properties and behavior; try everything in your inventory! Don't worry, the items are returned after being shot. (Experimental)
 - A completely new weapon type: Orbitals. These 12 items spread throughout the game choose the player's highest damage between magic and melee, and while active they stay near the caster as they deal damage to enemies and provide boosts and effects. The orbitals don't occupy buff slots and their damage doesn't interfere with other piercing weapons!
 - 3 melee weapons, 4 ranged weapons, and 3 magic weapons, all unique and finetuned, with new mechanics.
